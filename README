Assignment 1 README

1. (worked on assignment alone)

2. Below are the steps I took to complete this assignment
    - I first installed VMWare Workbench to create a Linux VM
    - I downloaded an Ubuntu Linux Image to mount onto the VM so that I can install that distribution of linux onto my VM
    - I then created my VM. Notable settings include setting VMX capability (so that a nested VM is possible) and setting 2 vCPUs, 4096 MB of RAM, and 200 GB of disk storage (on an external hard drive).
    - I then downloaded the assignment 1 code and Makefile (cmpe283-1.c) directly from Canvas onto the VM. 
    - I used git clone to clone the torvalds linux repository
    - I then edited the code file to comply with the assignment 1 guidelines. I referred Volume 3 Chapter 24 sections 6, 7, and 8 to find the Bit Positions of each of the control MSRs. I then made sure to read from each of these bits in the MSRs in the code file and output whether or not the control was settable and/or clearable.
    - After my additions to the template code file, I would build the code using make and mount the corresponding .ko module using the insmod command
    - I would verify my print output using the dmesg command and clean up my module using the rmmod command.
    - Finally, I committed the kernel module, C code file, and Makefile associated with this assignment to this code repository.
